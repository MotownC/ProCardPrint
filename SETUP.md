# Setup Instructions

## Add Your iOS App Logo

To complete the branding update:

1. Save your iOS app icon image (the neon trading card image) as `logo.png` in the ProCardPrint directory
2. The logo should be at least 80x80 pixels (higher resolution recommended for clarity)
3. Once saved, the logo will appear next to "PROCARD LEGENDS PRINT" in the header

The file should be saved at:
```
c:\Users\motow\ProCardPrint\logo.png
```

## Current Status

✅ Title updated to "PROCARD LEGENDS PRINT"
✅ HTML updated to include logo
✅ CSS styled to display logo with rounded corners and glow effect
⏳ Waiting for logo.png file to be added
